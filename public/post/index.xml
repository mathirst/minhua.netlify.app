      <description>Floats Full-width figures Use a fenced Div with the class fullwidth, e.g.,
::: {.fullwidth} Any Markdown content or code blocks here. ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(14, 4)} plot(sunspots) ``` ::: Figure 1: Monthly mean relative sunspot numbers from 1749 to 1983. Collected at Swiss Federal Observatory, Zurich until 1960, then Tokyo Astronomical Observatory. If you add the class fullscroll to the Div, the figure will be scrollable, e.g.,
::: {.fullwidth .fullscroll} ::: Figure 2: This is a super wide figure that you need to scroll to view it fully.</description>

      <description>Keep on as you have begun, and make all possible haste, so that you may have longer enjoyment of an improved mind, one that is at peace with itself.
Doubtless you will derive enjoyment during the time when you are improving your mind and setting it at peace with itself; but quite different is the pleasure which comes from contemplation when one’s mind is so cleansed from every stain that it shines.</description>

      <description>Judging by what you write me, and by what I hear, I am forming a good opinion regarding your future.
You do not run hither and thither and distract yourself by changing your abode; for such restlessness is the sign of a disordered spirit.
The primary indication, to my thinking, of a well-ordered mind is a man’s ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company.
Be careful, however, lest this reading of many authors and books of every sort may tend to make you discursive and unsteady.</description>

      <description>Greetings from Seneca to his friend Lucilius.
Continue to act thus, my dear Lucilius – set yourself free for your own sake; gather and save your time, which till lately has been forced from you, or filched away, or has merely slipped from your hands.
Make yourself believe the truth of my words, that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach.</description>
